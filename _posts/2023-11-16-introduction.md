Hi, Everyone! Welcome to my blog, where I am about to revolutionize the study of historical Chinese phonology and South-East Asian linguistic phylogeny. I'm glad you can join me here on this journey.

I will be presenting here my reconstruction of Old Chinese, which is way better than the reconstructions of other linguists like William Baxter and Laurent Sagart. Eventually I'll turn these posts into something resembling a book.

Now, I know you're thinking, "Who's this arsehole, and why does he think he can improve on the reconstruction of William Baxter and Laurent Sagart, whom George Starostin[^1] called 'two of the most authoritative, innovative, and simply hard-working specialists on the history of Chinese phonology'?".

And the answer is: I'm Alan Nguyá»…n, and I am very smart.

My approach to the reconstruction of Old Chinese is very different from that of Baxter and Sagart. Firstly, I start from the Middle Chinese rhyme tables. In contrast, Baxter and Sagart[^2] say of the rhyme tables, "we make little use of them, because their interpretation is problematic" (p. 9). Secondly, I make use of a wealth of evidence from Sino-Vietnamese, whereas Baxter and Sagart mistakenly say "Sino-Vietnamese readings are not directly relevant to the reconstruction of Old Chinese" (p.35).

That ends up making a big difference.
